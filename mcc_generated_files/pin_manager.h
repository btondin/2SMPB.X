/**
  PIN MANAGER Generated Driver File

  @Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  @File Name:
    pin_manager.h

  @Summary:
    This is the generated manager file for the PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs device.  This manager
    configures the pins direction, initial state, analog setting.
    The peripheral pin select, PPS, configuration is also handled by this manager.

  @Description:
    This source file provides implementations for PIN MANAGER.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC24 / dsPIC33 / PIC32MM MCUs - 1.171.1
        Device            :  PIC24FJ64GB002
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC16 v1.70
        MPLAB 	          :  MPLAB X v5.50
