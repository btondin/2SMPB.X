# OMRON 2SMPB_02E PIC16 Library

Welcome to the 2SMPB_02E PIC16 Library, designed for interfacing the Omron 2SMPB-02E sensor with an PIC16 MCU.

The 2SMPB-02E is a compact MEMS absolute pressure sensor renowned for its high accuracy and low current consumption. It comes equipped with a built-in 24-bit ADC and low-noise features, making it an ideal choice for precise atmospheric pressure measurements. Control and data output are achieved using digital methods through the I2C/SPI interface, allowing for automatic sleep mode and reduced power consumption.
